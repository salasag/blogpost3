### Hello World Analysis
My audience was essentially anyone who likes messing around with a psuedo physics simulation. Something I really liked about my work was that it was at its core a very simple project but came together really nicely even though there wasn't a lot going on. I used randomized colors that were dependent on the x,y coordinates and the time which I thought added a couple cool patterns. In the next iteration I want to spend more time picking more intentional colors and user interaction. I really enjoy cool patterns that come from simple mathematical formulas so this was a pretty good direction to go in.

### What is Art?
Jeff Coons really sees art as a way to relax and says he has a constantly evolving relationship with it. Wolfgang Laib spoke to his idea generation and said that he doesn't just get idea some random day but more steadily cultivates them over time. This is interesting to me as I've always wait for just a good idea to pop in my head when wait for inspiration. The effort he put toward collecting pollen was also outstanding. Hilary Lloyd creates very raw videos as part of her style and places a strong emphasis on the importance of her equipment. She says one shouldn't really "get" the art. As far as my own work I think I should more consiously draw on my experiences like these artists do which should help my work.
